      <h2>About Earl Naswell</h2>
      <p><strong>January 21, 1931 – October 6, 2020</strong></p>
      <p>
        Earl Naswell was born in Minnedosa, Manitoba, to John and Mary Naswell. A devoted father of seven children,
        grandfather of fourteen, and great-grandfather of thirteen, Earl was a kind and hardworking man who made an
        extraordinary impact on the Comox Valley community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1982, Earl began what would become one of Vancouver Island’s most cherished traditions: the Earl Naswell
        Community Christmas Dinner. What started as a simple act of kindness for a few friends grew into a
        community-wide event that now serves over 500 people annually. Earl’s passion and humility inspired countless
        volunteers and donors to come together every Christmas Day to ensure no one went without a hot meal or holiday
        companionship.
