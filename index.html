    <h2>About Earl Naswell</h2>
    <p><strong>January 21, 1931 â€“ October 6, 2020</strong></p>
    <p>
      Earl Naswell was born in Minnedosa, Manitoba, to John and Mary Naswell. A devoted father of seven children,
      grandfather of fourteen, and great-grandfather of thirteen, Earl was a kind and hardworking man who made an
      extraordinary impact on the Comox Valley community.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1982, Earl began what would become one of Vancouver Islandâ€™s most cherished traditions: the Earl Naswell
      Community Christmas Dinner. What started as a simple act of kindness for a few friends grew into a community-wide
      event that now serves over 500 people annually. Earlâ€™s passion and humility inspired countless volunteers and
      donors to come together every Christmas Day to ensure no one went without a hot meal or holiday companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Earl passed away in 2020, his spirit of generosity lives on through the annual dinner and the countless
      lives he touched. His legacy continues to be a beacon of hope, service, and community for all who knew him and
      those who continue to benefit from his vision.
