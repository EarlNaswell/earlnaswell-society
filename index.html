      <h2>About Earl Naswell</h2>
      <p><strong>January 21, 1931 – October 6, 2020</strong></p>
      <p>
        Earl Naswell was born in Minnedosa, Manitoba, to John and Mary Naswell. A devoted father of seven children, grandfather of fourteen, and great-grandfather of thirteen, Earl was a kind and hardworking man who made an extraordinary impact on the Comox Valley community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1982, Earl began what would become one of Vancouver Island’s most cherished traditions: the Earl Naswell Community Christmas Dinner. What started as a simple act of kindness for a few friends grew into a community-wide event that now serves over 500 people annually. Earl’s passion and humility inspired countless volunteers and donors to come together every Christmas Day to ensure no one went without a hot meal or holiday companionship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Earl passed away in 2020, his spirit of generosity lives on through the annual dinner and the countless lives he touched. His legacy continues to be a beacon of hope, service, and community for all who knew him and those who continue to benefit from his vision.
